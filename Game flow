#Player 1 makes move
#picks one column for solid piece or two columns for superposed pieces
#only permit move if there is space, otherwise force the player to retry move

#call collapse, which will only execute if board is full
#call gravity
#call victory

#if game doesnt end Player 2 makes his move just like player 1

#call collapse, gravity and victory
#rinse and repeat until victory or tie conditions are satisfied
