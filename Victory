#only solid, non superposed pieces are counted for victory
#any winning piece MUST not be sitting above any superposed pieces, because the connect 4 could fail after collapse and gravity

#four endgame conditions possible- (1) player 1 wins (2) player 2 wins 
#or (3) the board is filled up by SOLID pieces yet no winning combo exists, hence a tie 
#(4) after quantum collapse and gravity both players get one or more winning combos, which is also a tie

#check condition (1)
#check condition (2)
#if both are false, proceed with game, unless the board is full (3) then end game
#if (1) and (2) are true, then (4) and end game
#if one is true and other false, then victory for one player and end game
